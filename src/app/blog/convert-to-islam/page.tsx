            The Importance of Intention
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            In Islam, every action begins with an intention (niyyah). If your heart sincerely seeks the truth and you are ready to submit to the One God, your journey toward Islam has already begun. This intention is the cornerstone of faith and will guide you through your spiritual transformation.
          </p>
  
          {/* The Shahada: Declaration of Faith */}
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-red-500 mb-6">
            The Shahada: Declaration of Faith
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            The first and most important step in converting to Islam is reciting the Shahada with full conviction: <strong>"Ash-hadu an la ilaha illa Allah, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadur Rasul Allah."</strong> This translates to: <em>"I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah."</em> 
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            By reciting the Shahada, you affirm your belief in the oneness of Allah and the finality of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This declaration is the gateway to becoming a Muslim.

            Understanding the Pillars of Islam
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Once you have declared your faith, the next step is to understand and practice the Five Pillars of Islam, which form the foundation of a Muslim’s life:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-left mb-8 list-disc list-inside">
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Shahada (Faith):</strong> The declaration that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Salah (Prayer):</strong> Performing the five daily prayers, which connect you with Allah throughout the day.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Zakat (Charity):</strong> Giving a portion of your wealth to those in need, promoting social justice and compassion.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Sawm (Fasting):</strong> Observing the fast during the month of Ramadan, which teaches self-control, empathy, and spiritual growth.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Hajj (Pilgrimage):</strong> Performing the pilgrimage to Mecca if you are physically and financially able.
            </li>
          </ul>
  
          {/* Learning to Pray */}
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-red-500 mb-6">
            Learning to Pray (Salah)
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            One of the first practices new Muslims learn is Salah, the five daily prayers. These prayers are performed at dawn, midday, afternoon, sunset, and evening. Prayer is a direct link between you and Allah, providing structure, discipline, and peace in your daily life.
          </p>
  
          {/* Seeking Knowledge */}
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-red-500 mb-6">
            Seeking Knowledge and Growth
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Islam places a strong emphasis on seeking knowledge. As a new Muslim, take time to study the Quran, Hadith (sayings of the Prophet), and Islamic history. Joining a local mosque or Islamic center can provide support and resources as you learn more about your faith.
          </p>
  
          {/* Building a Community */}
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-red-500 mb-6">
            Building a Supportive Community
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Being part of the Muslim community (ummah) can greatly support your journey. Attend Friday prayers (Jumu'ah), participate in community events, and connect with fellow Muslims who can guide and encourage you.
          </p>
  
          {/* Final Thoughts */}
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-red-500 mb-6">
            Final Thoughts
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Embracing Islam is a lifelong journey filled with growth, learning, and spiritual fulfillment. Trust in Allah’s guidance, remain patient, and continue to seek knowledge. Islam is a path of peace, purpose, and connection with the Divine.
