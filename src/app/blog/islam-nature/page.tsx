          Islam and Nature
        </h1>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Islam teaches a deep respect for nature as a reflection of Allah’s creation. The Quran encourages humans to protect and appreciate the natural world, seeing it as a sign of Allah’s power, beauty, and wisdom.

          Stewardship of the Earth
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-8">
          Muslims are entrusted with the responsibility of caring for the environment. This concept, known as <strong>"khalifa"</strong>, emphasizes the duty to protect the earth’s resources and use them responsibly. In the Quran, Allah says: <em>“It is He who has made you successors on the earth...”</em> (Quran 35:39).
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-red-500 mb-6">
          Nature as a Reflection of Divine Beauty
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-8">
          The natural world is a manifestation of Allah’s beauty and power. The Quran invites believers to observe the wonders of creation and reflect on their significance. Mountains, rivers, plants, and animals all serve as reminders of the Creator’s infinite wisdom. The verse, <em>“And on the earth are signs for the certain [in faith]”</em> (Quran 51:20), underscores this connection.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-red-500 mb-6">
          Islam and Scientific Inquiry
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-8">
          Islam places a strong emphasis on seeking knowledge and understanding the natural world. The Quran encourages curiosity and exploration. The verse <em>“Do they not look at the sky above them?”</em> (Quran 50:6) invites believers to observe and reflect on the universe, aligning with the scientific method.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-red-500 mb-6">
          The Big Bang and Creation
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-8">
          The Quran's description of creation aligns with the modern Big Bang Theory. The verse <em>“Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them...”</em> (Quran 21:30) echoes the scientific understanding of the universe's origin.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-red-500 mb-6">
          The Expansion of the Universe
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-8">
          The Quran hints at the continuous expansion of the universe. Allah says, <em>“And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander.”</em> (Quran 51:47). This aligns with modern cosmology's understanding of an expanding universe.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-red-500 mb-6">
          Embryology and Human Development
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-8">
          The Quran accurately describes stages of embryonic development long before modern science confirmed them. <em>“We created man from a drop, then We made the drop into a clinging clot...”</em> (Quran 23:12-14) mirrors our current knowledge of embryology.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-red-500 mb-6">
          Environmental Ethics in Islam
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-8">
          Islam’s teachings promote ethical practices toward the environment. Wasting water, harming animals, and polluting the earth are discouraged. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, <em>“Do not waste water, even if you perform your ablution on the banks of an abundantly-flowing river.”</em>
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-red-500 mb-6">
          Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-8">
          Islam beautifully bridges faith, nature, and science. By reflecting on the teachings of the Quran and the Hadith, Muslims are encouraged to pursue knowledge, protect the environment, and appreciate the harmony in creation. This holistic approach fosters a spiritual and ethical responsibility toward a sustainable future.
