            Islam: The True Religion
          </h1>
  
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Islam is not just a religion; it is a complete way of life, offering guidance on all aspects of existence. It is the final and complete message from Allah (God), sent through His final messenger, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Islam teaches the path to righteousness, justice, and peace, providing solutions for both individual and societal problems.

            The Oneness of Allah (Tawhid)
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            At the core of Islam is the belief in the Oneness of Allah, known as Tawhid. Islam teaches that there is no god but Allah, and He is the sole Creator, Sustainer, and Ruler of the universe. The Quran repeatedly emphasizes the absolute monotheism of Allah, such as in the verse: <em>"Say, 'He is Allah, [Who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent.'" (Quran 112:1-4)</em>

            The Final Revelation: The Quran
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Islam is based on the belief that the Quran is the final, unaltered word of Allah, revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) over a span of 23 years. The Quran serves as a comprehensive guide for all aspects of life—spiritual, moral, social, and legal. It addresses humanity’s need for guidance and offers wisdom for all time. Allah says in the Quran: <em>"This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah." (Quran 2:2)</em>

            Prophethood and the Last Messenger
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the final messenger of Allah. He was sent to complete the message of all previous prophets and to guide humanity toward the worship of the One True God. His life, teachings, and actions (Sunnah) provide a perfect example for Muslims to follow. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: <em>"I have been sent to perfect good character." (Sunan al-Bayhaqi)</em>

            The Five Pillars of Islam
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            The practice of Islam is built upon five fundamental acts of worship known as the Five Pillars. These pillars are the foundation of a Muslim's faith and practice:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-8">
            <li><strong>Shahada (Faith):</strong> The declaration of faith that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger.</li>
            <li><strong>Salah (Prayer):</strong> Muslims are required to pray five times a day, facing the Kaaba in Mecca, to maintain their connection with Allah.</li>
            <li><strong>Zakat (Charity):</strong> Muslims are required to give a portion of their wealth to those in need, purifying their wealth and helping those less fortunate.</li>
            <li><strong>Sawm (Fasting):</strong> Fasting during the month of Ramadan to develop self-discipline and empathy for the poor.</li>
            <li><strong>Hajj (Pilgrimage):</strong> Every Muslim who is physically and financially able must make the pilgrimage to Mecca once in their lifetime.</li>
          </ul>

            Islam: A Religion of Peace and Justice
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Islam is a religion of peace, justice, and compassion. It teaches that true peace comes from submission to the will of Allah and following His guidance. The Quran encourages justice, kindness, and equality for all people, regardless of race, status, or religion. Allah says in the Quran: <em>"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you." (Quran 49:13)</em>
          </p>

            The Role of Muslims in Society
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Muslims are encouraged to contribute positively to society, embodying the principles of justice, compassion, and respect for others. Islam teaches that the pursuit of knowledge, helping others, and working for the betterment of society are acts of worship when done in accordance with Islamic principles. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: <em>"The best of people are those who are most beneficial to others." (Daraqutni)</em>
          </p>

            Conclusion: Islam as the True Path
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Islam, as the final and complete religion, provides a comprehensive framework for achieving peace in both this world and the Hereafter. It teaches the oneness of God, the importance of following the guidance of the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and the essential pillars of faith that strengthen one’s relationship with Allah. Embracing Islam brings one closer to the truth and helps in leading a life filled with purpose, justice, and peace.
