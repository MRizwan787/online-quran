              The Quran's Impact on Society
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontFamily: "Times New Roman, serif" }}>
              Beyond individual transformation, the Quran has a profound impact on society. It lays the foundation for justice, equity, and compassion. The Quran teaches us to care for the poor, protect the rights of others, and treat all people with respect, irrespective of their background or beliefs.

The teachings of the Quran encourage cooperation, eliminate division, and inspire a spirit of generosity and empathy, leading to a peaceful and thriving society.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontFamily: "Times New Roman, serif" }}>
              The Quran also emphasizes the importance of education and knowledge. It encourages us to seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave and to use that knowledge to benefit ourselves and others. A society that values education and knowledge is more likely to be prosperous, innovative, and progressive. By promoting a culture of learning, the Quran helps to create a more informed and enlightened community.
